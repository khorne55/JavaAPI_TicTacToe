This class creates a thread which monitors the game in progress.
It tells which user to Go or wait and sets the winner once the game is finished
The thread checks with the webserive every 200ms who the last person to select a tile.
From this the thread is able to work out if its player 1 or player 2's go.
If the game is over the correct text is shown to the user and plays stopped.
